    This project takes population trends from many different countries and finds the top 10 countries for population growth over 55 years (1952 - 2007). Population
data is extracted from a csv file. The top ten countries are extracted from the csv file and the relevant data is taken. A pie chart shows the contribution of 
each top 10 country to the entire population growth of all top 10 countries. A bar graph shows each top country's numerical population growth in millions. 
An interactable projection is made for the population of a top 10 country in the future. 
The prompt is as follows:

Type a top ten country: 
 - China
You chose China
How many years from 1952?
 - 70
70 years from 1952 is 2022
Based on the average population growth per year from 1952 to 2007; in year 2022 the population of China will be 970.35399 million people or 0.9703599 billion people.
